> Basic Programming Exercises

This repository is intended for exercises and solutions to everyday problems that aim to complement the exercise of thinking in terms of logic applied in a programming language.

The solutions given to these exercises are *programming language agnostic*, the main objective is to solve problems of different scales not the compression and operation of a programming language.
