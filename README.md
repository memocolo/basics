> Basic Programming Exercises

This repository is intended for exercises and solutions to everyday problems that aim to complement the exercise of thinking in terms of logic applied in a programming language.

The main objective is to apply an ambiguous programming language to solve problems of different scales, it is not dedicated to the compression and operation of the programming language itself but of the procedure in solving a given problem.
